                    <p class="grid2-text-1">3 CONCEPT EYES is a South Korean cosmetics brand with a unique philosophy. The brand based its name on the idea of three kinds of attractive eyes. Catering to the highly urbanized and confident modern woman, 3
                        CONCEPT EYES makeup uses a primary color palette of pink, orange and beige, which are versatile enough to mix and match different skin tones. </p>
                    <p class="grid2-text-2">The brand has also launched an expanded spectrum of shades for its eye makeup, nail polish and
                        lip color lines.Korean lifestyle makeup and fashion company Nanda Co. was first founded by CEO Kim So-Hee in Seoul in 2004. Its flagship brand Stylenanda began as a fashion business, and has since become a company spearheaded by its
                        make-up brand 3CE which today represents more than 70% of the business.</p>

                    <p class="grid3-text">Across Asia, there is a media-driven obsession with the “Korean girl” archetype, a phenomenon that resembles the “French girl mystique” that often bubbles up in North America. More K-pop concerts are staged annually in
                        Japan than in Korea. Clothing from Dongdaemun market — the same industrious stalls from which Stylenanda was conceived — populates small boutiques throughout Asia. The rate of double-eyelid surgeries — commonplace for Korean pop stars,
                        models and actresses — continues to surge across the continent.</p>

                        that is like picking up clothes from Zara but [because of the merchandising] it feels like you are buying it from a boutique store,” Kim said. A source noted that in line with her business savvy, Kim purchases the properties on which her
                        stores are situated rather than renting them.<br>
