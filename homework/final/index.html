            <p>I love cooking, so I think I know some easy recipe for Chinese food and desserts. I am focusing on people who don’t know how to cook or who don’t have time to cook. But it’s life, we do have to cook sometimes, for
                your girlfriend, boy boyfriend, or for yourself. This is what my brother told me, last time we met is because he wanted to cook for his girlfriend, but he didn’t know what to do or how to do. The only thing he wanted is simple, fast and
                tasted
                good. For people like my brother, especially for men, they don’t want the recipe and cooking processing to be long and complicated, that’s why you can see this website now~~~~~~

                            <li>Place 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan or wok. Cook the beef in 2 small batches over medium high until browned, about
                                2-3 minutes (beef does not need to be cooked through). Remove from pan and set aside.

                            <li>So, what kind of beef is best for stir fry? I use either sirloin or flank steak in my beef stir fry recipe because it is
                                tasty, affordable, and can be easily tenderized. You can use chuck steak as well. The secret to making the best beef
                                stir fry using flank steak is all in how you slice the meat. Thin slices, across the grain is the key. Here’s how to do it:
                            </li>
                            <li>Trim away any silver skin, or other tough connective tissue that often surrounds a cut of beef.</li>
                            <li>Look at the way the grains are running, you will see long lines of muscle.</li>
                            <li>You want to slice across the long lines (across the grain) for the most tender meat. I cut 1/4 inch thick.</li>
